# An-approach-to-recognize-masked-face-using-Deep-Learning
We have trained a deep learning architecture on a dataset collected from various sources which contains images of people with and without masks. We have used CNN model with several activation function and dropout combinations and got 97.4% accuracy for previously unseen test data. We have also implemented a prototype web app that can take input of an image and detect whether that person has worn a facial mask or not.
